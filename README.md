# forkify Project

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads.
This project was created as part of the "The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!"
course taught by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. During the course, I was guided through the development of this application, which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of modern web development techniques.
Although this project was built based on the course, my goal was to fully understand its functionality, and now I would be able to build a similar application on my own.
